README for unbound 1.*

REQUIREMENTS

PRE/POST-INSTALL

1. Create a user/group unbound with a unused id < 99 or run the
   provided pre-install script:

   'groupadd -r unbound'
   'useradd -r -g unbound -d /etc/unbound -s /bin/false unbound'
   'passwd -l unbound'

PRECAUTION

To enable DNSSEC validation all you have to do is to enable the 
"auto-trust-anchor-file" option in /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.
Unbound runs as default within a chroot located at /etc/unbound, 
therefor the anchor-file has to reside somewhere below the chroot 
directory. The default is /etc/unbound/anchor/root.key.

The effective user unbound is running as (default: unbound) needs
write access to /etc/unbound/anchor to update the trust anchor for 
DNSSEC validation. Adjust the owner of that directory if you run 
unbound as a different user.
