NOTES

    PF_RING

    To get beyond 2 million packets/second, you need an Intel 10-gbps Ethernet
    adapter and a special driver known as "PF_RING ZC" from ntop:

    http://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/pf_ring-zc-zero-copy/

    Masscan doesn't need to be rebuilt in order to use PF_RING.
    To use PF_RING, you need to build the following components:

    libpfring.so (installed in /usr/lib/libpfring.so)
    pf_ring.ko (their kernel driver)
    ixgbe.ko (their version of the Intel 10-gbps Ethernet driver)

    You don't need to build their version of libpcap.so.

    When Masscan detects that an adapter is named something like zc:enp1s0
    instead of something like enp1s0, it'll automatically switch to PF_RING ZC
    mode.
