README for monit

POST-INSTALL

  Edit monitrc control file as you need (/usr/etc/monitrc)
  
  Also, monit can run and be controlled from init.
  If monit should crash, init will re-spawn a new monit process.
  To setup monit to run from init, you can use the 'set init' statement
  in monitrc and then edit your /etc/inittab as:
  
  # Run monit in standard run-levels
  mo:2345:respawn:/usr/bin/monit -Ic /usr/etc/monitrc
