This is a fork of denyhosts, it'll run the same with a few small changes. I
expect more code cleanup and a total shift to iptables in future.

REQUIREMENTS:

PRECAUTION:

PRE-INSTALL:

POST-INSTALL:

Edit /etc/denyhosts/denyhosts.conf as needed.

Edit /etc/inetd.conf, I added:

#<service_name> <sock_type> <proto> <flags> <user> <server_path> <args>
sshd		stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/sshd in.sshd

Add inetd and denyhosts to services array on /etc/rc.conf, after net and before sshd is loaded (and any other services used by denyhost and inetd (not sure if this is necessary but i believe its good to allow protection before the services start).

PRE-REMOVE:

POST-REMOVE:

NOTES:

To protect sshd.

Edit /etc/hosts.allow and comment out everything, everything will have access by default.

Edit /etc/hosts.deny and comment out the "ALL: ALL: DENY" part, also the "#End of file" bit will be useless as denyhosts appends to the file.

(note the config in inetd.conf doesn't seem to be right or needed? see
messages upon boot up, any corrections email me :) )
